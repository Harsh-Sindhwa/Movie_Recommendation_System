# Movie_Recommendation_System

A Recommendation structure is a sort of data isolating framework that tries to foresee the propensities of a customer and make proposals dependent on these inclinations. There is a wide variety of usage of these structures. These have gotten intelligently standard over the range of the most recent couple of years and are now being utilized in most online stages that we use. Hence, we are utilizing these recommendation systems in order to improve movie predictions based on the interests of user.

# Movie Recommendation System
Movie Recommendation system is a prediction system which understands the user interests on movies, based on the data collected and anticipates the kind of movies they would like to watch in the next usages. These systems have become very important and standard in many online platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Youtube, etc.


# Recommendation System
Recommendations are basically of two types. The first system is Content based filtering. It utilizes the client’s profile data, their activities, especially recent activities, and then predicts/suggests movies which might grab the user’s attention. The other majorly used recommendation system is Collaborative based filtering. This method gathers data of clients who watches similar kinds of movies, and are comparable, and then suggests or proposes the new items based on the likability’s of each client.
For our “Movie Recommendation System”, we have considered the Content based filtering structure to propose new movies to the users.
